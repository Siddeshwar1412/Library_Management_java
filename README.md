### **📖 How `LibraryData.txt` Works (Optional)**
- This file can be used to **store book data persistently**, so the book list remains even after restarting the program.  
- If implemented, the program can **read/write book details** to this file.  
- **Future Improvement**: You can modify the project to save book data using **File Handling in Java**.
